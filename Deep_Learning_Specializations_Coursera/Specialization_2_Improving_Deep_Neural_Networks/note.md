# Week1

High bias:underfit-> solve by complex model

High variance:overfitting-> solve by more data

regularization can solve both issues-> prevent offerfitting

Example: L2 regularization on logistic regression-> euclidean norm 

w has larger space->need better fitting

L1 reg-> w vector more zero->compress the model and sparse

with lamda set by dev set  

Frobenius norm sume of square element of matrix

add extract regularization term after the dw differential (weight decay)
